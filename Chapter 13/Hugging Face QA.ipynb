    "# Building a Question-Answering System with Hugging Face Transformers\n",

    "Hugging Face’s transformers package contains several pretrained BERT models already fine-tuned for specific tasks. One example is the “minilm-uncased-squad2” model, which was trained with Stanford’s [SQuAD 2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset to answer questions by extracting text from documents. To get a feel for what models like this one can accomplish, let’s use it to build a simple question-answering system.\n",

    "Begin by using the following statements to load a pretrained MiniLM model from the Hugging-Face hub and a tokenizer to tokenize text input to the model. Then compose a pipeline from them. The first time you run this code, you'll experience a momentary delay while the pretrained weights are downloaded. After that, loading will be fast because the weights are cached:"

      "There are five versions of YOLO referred to as YOLOv1 through YOLOv5. There are also variations such as PP-YOLO and YOLO9000. YOLOv3 processes the image using a 13x13 grid, a 26x26 grid, and a 52x52 grid so it can detect objects large and small. It borrows the anchor-box concept from Faster R-CNN to predict nine bounding boxes per cell. YOLO’s primary weakness is that it has difficulty detecting small objects that are close together. This is a consequence of the fact that a given cell can only predict one class. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the R-CNN family of object-detection systems delivers unparalleled accuracy, it leaves something to be desired when it comes to real-time object detection of the type required by, say, self-driving cars. A paper entitled “You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection” published in 2015 proposed an alternative to R-CNNs known as YOLO that revolutionized the way data scientists think about object detection. \n",

      "Until a few short years ago, most NMT models, including the one underlying Google Translate, were LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence models. In such models, one or more LSTM layers encode a tokenized input sequence representing the phrase to be translated into a vector. A second set of recurrent layers uses that vector as input and decodes it into a tokenized phrase in another language. The model accepts sequences as input and returns sequences as output, hence the term sequence-to-sequence model. A softmax output layer at the end outputs a set of probabilities for each token in the output sequence. If the maximum output phrase length that’s supported is 20 tokens, for example, and the vocabulary of the output language contains 20,000 words, then the output is 20 sets (one per token) of 20,000 probabilities. For each possible output token, the word selected is the word assigned the highest probability.\n",

And the larger the corpus of text, the more such a system would benefit from a product such as Haystack. The key, however, is a reading-comprehension model that can make sense of the questions asked of it. For that, pretrained models from Hugging Face stand ready to get you up and running quickly."
