    "# Audio Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "You are the leader of a group of climate scientists who are concerned about the planet's dwindling rain forests. The world loses up to 10 million acres of old-growth rain forests each year, much of it due to illegal logging. Deforestation from this and other causes accounts for about 10% of global carbon emissions. Your team plans to convert thousands of discarded smart phones into solar-powered listening devices and position them throughout the Amazon to transmit alerts in response to the sounds of chainsaws and truck engines. You need software to install on these phones that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify such sounds in real time. And you need it fast, because climate change won't wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio classification can be performed by converting audio streams into [spectrograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram), which provide visual representations of spectrums of frequencies as they vary over time, and classifying the spectrograms using [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNNs). The spectrograms below were generated from WAV files with chainsaw sounds in the foreground and rainforest sounds in the background. Let's use Keras to build a CNN that can identify the tell-tale sounds of logging operations and distinguish them from ambient sounds such as wildlife and thunderstorms.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Images/spectrograms.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was inspired by the [Rainforest Connection](https://rfcx.org/), which uses recycled Android phones and a TensorFlow model to monitor rain forests for sounds indicative of illegal activity. For more information, see [The fight against illegal deforestation with TensorFlow](https://blog.google/technology/ai/fight-against-illegal-deforestation-tensorflow/) in the Google AI blog. It is just one example of how AI is making the world a better place."

    "## Generate spectrograms\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Sounds\" directory contains subdirectories named \"background,\" \"chainsaw,\" \"engine,\" and \"storm.\" Each subdirectory contains 100 WAV files. The WAV files in the \"background\" directory contain rainforest background noises only, while the files in the other subdirectories include the sounds of chainsaws, engines, and thunderstorms overlaid on the background noises. These WAV files were generated by using a soundscape-synthesis package named [Scaper](https://pypi.org/project/scaper/) to combine sounds in the public [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) dataset with rainforest sounds obtained from YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to load the WAV files, use a Python package named [Librosa](https://librosa.org/) to generate spectrogram images from them, load the spectrograms into memory, and prepare them for use in training a CNN. To aid in this process, we'll define a pair of helper functions for creating spectrograms from WAV files and converting all the WAV files in a specified directory into spectrograms."

Remember that a neural network will train differently every time, in part because Keras initializes the weights and biases with small random values. In the real world, data scientists often train a neural network 20 or more times and average the results to quantify its accuracy."
