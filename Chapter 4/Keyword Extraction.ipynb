    "# Keyword extraction with `TfidfVectorizer`\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer` class creates matrices of word counts and is frequently uses in text-classification tasks. The related [`TfidfVectorizer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) class creates matrices of [Term Freqeuency-Inverse Document Frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) (TFIDF) values that reflect not just the presence of individual words, but each word's importance. One use for `TfidfVectorizer` is extracting keywords from documents. Let's use it to extract keywords from a book chapter on machine learning. Begin by loading the chapter from a text file and showing the first few paragraphs."
